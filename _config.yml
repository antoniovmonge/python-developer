          This platform allows us to search and compare products in a very detailed way.
          This platform has two complementary user types. "Manufacturers" and "Designers".
          It has CMS that allows members of **supplier companies** to upload their products.
          A functionality to export detailed reports of individual products and/or compare them will be implemented.
          
          The project includes:

          - Advanced user authentication
          - A Content Management System (CMS)
          - Model inheritance to create data models for polymorphic content
          - Complex permissions and roles assigned programmatically to the different types of users
          - A RESTful API using the Django REST framework
          - A full-text search engine with Django and PostgreSQL
          - Internal Email management. (*Contact us* and *Contact the manufacturer*)
          - Many more features will be added soon.

          2050 Materials is a start up that centralizes all sustainability 
          information into a single platform, enabling designers to save time and 
          money at any project stage.
          
          I helped the company to launch the product by:

          - Implementing the User Authentication system
          - Automating the permission and role assignment for the different kind of users 
          and companies (Advanced role/permission management through migrations)
          - Conducted Data Exploration using Jupyter Notebooks and Pandas to
          check data consistency and fixed issues by re-designing the data
          entry processes
          - Fixed database issues using Django migrations
          - Created the Landing Page using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and JavaScript.

          Minimal was an early-stage Start-Up based in London looking to create a data-driven shopping platform for sustainable fashion.

          During my time as a Python Developer Intern I helped the team by:

          - Designed and prototyped an e-commerce platform using Django
          - Automated the data entry through the integration of several APIs of
          WooCommerce and Shopify partners that used GraphQL saving
          weeks of manual and repetitive work
          - Designed the database after conducting a Data Exploration using
          Jupyter Notebook and Pandas

          During my Bootcamp I learnt to write code following the highest professional standards. 
          Among the new skills I learnt the value and joy of teamwork and handling with tight deadlines. 
          I thoroughly enjoyed my time at the Bootcamp and learnt a lot about a healthy work life balance and the
          power of motivation and passion in a nice team.

          The strong points of the Bootcamp were:
            - Data Science with Python 
            - Data Analytics with SQL, BigQuery, Pandas, Numpy, and Matplotlib
            - Statistics with Scipy, Seaborn and Statsmodels
            - Machine Learning with Scikit-learn
            - Deep Learning with TensorFlow Keras
            - Developing Data Products with Google Cloud Platform, ML Flow, Flask, Heroku and Streamlit.
